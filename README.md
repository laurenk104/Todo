# Project 1 - *Simple Todo*

**Todo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Lauren Krieger**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## GIF Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

The user can add items    
<img src='walkthrough/adding.gif' title='adding items' width='' alt='adding items' />

The user can remove items. In this case "bye!" is not really a task to do, so it was removed.   
<img src='walkthrough/removing.gif' title='removing items' width='' alt='removing items' />

If the user chooses to exit the app, their data is saved   
<img src='walkthrough/preserving.gif' title='item preservance' width='' alt='item preservance' />

## Notes

I had some difficulty setting up git and Android Studio, but making the app itself was fine.
